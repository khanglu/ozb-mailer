### ozb-mailer

### How it works
- Fetches all of the front page deals from the OzBargain home page
- Evaluates whether a deal has expired, ran out of stock or is still valid
- Constructs a JSON to house all of the deals
- Process the JSON through an algorithm to determine whether a deal is good or not
- If a deal is good, then add to mongoDB and send email(s) to designated email address(es)
